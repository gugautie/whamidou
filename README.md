I received the Ph.D. degree in signal and image processing from the University of Poitiers, France, in 2010. From 2011 to 2012, I was a Research Engineer with the Canon Research Centre, Rennes, France. Since 2015, I have been an Associate Professor with INSA Rennes. He is currently a member of the Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes (IETR), UMR CNRS 6164 and b<>com research Institute. I am the co-authors of more than 140+ papers in image processing conferences and journals. My research interests include video coding, design of software and hardware circuits and systems for video coding standards, quality assessment, and multimedia security.
