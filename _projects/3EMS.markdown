<p align="justify">   The 3EMS project, for "Energy Efficient Enhanced Media Streaming", aims to develop and market technical solutions allowing the broadcasting of linear video content based on the most recent video coding and distribution standards. The project revolves around four main axes. First, it is based on the “Versatile Video Coding” (VVC) video coding standard, which represents the state-of-the-art in video compression, and whose specification was finalized in July 2020. Second, the project is based on the use of broadcast and multicast broadcasting techniques on new 5G broadcasting networks, the first commercial deployments of which in France are also planned for 2020. Third, the project explores the use of artificial intelligence techniques in order to 'optimize the quality of the video signal, its coding and its quality at the user's terminal. Finally, the project addresses the issue of reducing the energy consumption required toprocess, distribute and restore video content, in particular via resolution adaptation solutions, pre- and post-processing in connection with final perceived video quality control.  </p>
