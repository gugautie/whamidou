##### **DEEPTEC**: Delivery over Energy-Efficient Processing and Transcoding in Edge Computing 2022-2024
##### **Partners**: <a href="https://www.aviwest.com/fr/accueil/">Aviwest</a>, <a href="https://www.tdf.fr/">TDF</a> and <a href="https://www.insa-rennes.fr/">INSA Rennes</a> 
##### **Key words**: Edge computing, virtualisation, 5G, streaming, energy, transcoding. 
##### Project funded by <a href="https://www.bretagne.bzh/">Region Bretagne</a>. 

<p align="justify">  The DEEPTEC project, for Delivery over Energy-Efficient Processing and Transcoding in Edge Computing, aims to develop an innovative solution for broadcasting live audiovisual content. It relies on the 5G ecosystem and the virtualization of services in order to optimize video processing and significantly reduce the environmental impact related to the consumption of video content. Relying on the high speed 5G network and Edge Computing will allow critical processing (preparation, transcoding, encapsulation) to be carried out as close as possible to the location of the event, with almost no-latency and secure transmission. Artificial intelligence techniques will be integrated in the project to offer the user the best visual quality with the lowest possible energy cost. The broadcast chain will be fully virtualized up to the broadcast network head. Depending on the audience level of the program, the latter will automatically switch to the most efficient broadcasting channel (terrestrial or IP) from the energy point of view. </p>
